<h2>Hi, I'm Vincent. I love building exciting, impactful and scalable products</h2>

### What I'm up to:

- Software Engineering Intern at Coursera (Summer'22)
- Engineering Lead of [HackSC](http://hacksc.com) -- Southern California's flagship hackathon
- Undergraduate Researcher at the [ICAROS](http://icaros.usc.edu) lab, where I contribute mostly to [pyribs](http://pyribs.org)

### Things I just simply love:

- __Music__; mostly lo-fi and jazz but sometimes I might feel like listening to emo rocks or something like that instead
- __Linux__; I currently dual-boot between Window 11 and Debian 11 w/ suckless's DWM as the windows manager
- __Cats__: I don't normally like Instagram posts, but when I do, those likes are for cat videos.
-  __Gaming__: I have a great childhood gaming away on my dad's Windows 7 PC, playing cringy-ass Flash games that have now unfortunately fell out of support; I mostly play Valorant nowadays
