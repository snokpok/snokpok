<h1 align="center">🧑‍💻</h1>

<h4 align="center">I love building exciting, impactful and scalable products</h4>

### What I'm up to:

- 📚 Software Engineer Intern @ [Coursera](http://coursera.org) (Summer'22) -- Platform Foundations
- 🌺 Lead of Engineering @ [HackSC](http://hacksc.com) -- Southern California's flagship hackathon

### Things I'm interested in:

- 🔨 __Startups__: It's not interesting being in a cocoon full of comfort because nothing grows out of it. I love startups and solo creators who build products that has the potential to disrupt the market. I have always put innovation first, and I strive to create an environment where that can be grown and fostered.
- 📊 __Cloud infrastructure & observability__: I have a great passion for developing scalable microservices and infrastructures on the cloud, where I get a lot of experience doing this at HackSC building hackathon portals, services and all. Observability became an extremely important topic as I continue scaling our tech stack, and I have always been focused on finding great ways to do logging, tracing and APMs ever since. Have experience playing around with observability tools such as Grafana, Prometheus, and New Relic.
- 🎷 __Music__: mostly lo-fi and jazz but sometimes I might feel like listening to emo rock or something like that instead
- 👾 __Linux__: I currently boot i3wm on Manjaro. Highly recommend!
- 😺 __Cats__: I don't often like Instagram posts, but when I do, those likes are for cat videos **only**.
- 🕹 __Gaming__: I have an avid childhood gaming away on my dad's Windows 7 PC playing cringy-ass Flash games that have now unfortunately fell out of support; I mostly play Valorant nowadays
